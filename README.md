# RpgChronicle (Capstone Version)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.1.

## How to Install

Download
Run `npm update`
Go to /server and run `nodemon server.js`
Go to /client and run `ng serve`

## How to Use

RPG Chronicle is a collaborative storytelling program.
First, decide which player is the Narrator and which is the Player.
The Player creates a character on the Characters page, and use its page to keep track of the character's inventory.
Create a story on the Stories page, then use its chat-like system to post beats of a story (on the part of the narrator) and story decisions and questions (by the player).

## Capstone Project

This was done as a final project for the Cohort 6 Web Development Certification course at MTECH, for the following assignment:

- Make an application using Angular (DONE)
- Create an Express server to run the application
- Create a SQL or NoSQL database
- Host the application on a hosting service

I was not able to figure out how to convert a purely Firebase-based application to a Mongo database, and I was not able to figure out hosting.
